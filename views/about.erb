    <h1>Our mission: Make Philadelphia a more accessible city that welcomes and embraces people with disabilities.</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
  <h2>Why? <small>Philadelphia is an incredible city with world class food, art, entertainment and job opportunities. However, access is not equal; many of us are locked out of buildings, transit, education and opportunites due to poor access and facilities. We want to change this now.</small></h2>
  </div>
  
  <div>
  <h2>How? <small>We're using open data sets*, crowdsourcing and social media. We map and visualize the information we collect to help us find accessible locations and services. When we spot problems and patterns we talk and <a href='https://twitter.com/unlockphilly/media' target='_blank'>tweet</a> about them to raise visibility and bring about change. We also <a href='http://www.generocity.org/menagerie-coffee-stands-out-as-an-accessible-cafe-in-old-city/' target='_blank'>highlight businesses</a> and organizations that go out of their way to provide fantastic, accessible service. We've had <a href='http://www.tyack.net/2014/03/23/nbc-philadelphia-runs-story-on-transit-app-and-accessibility-following-tweets/' target='_blank'>great success with this strategy</small></a></h2>
