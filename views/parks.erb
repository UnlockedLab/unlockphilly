					<p>This page is a prototype that describes and maps both accessibility and inaccessibility in the park. Please leave comments below to provide feedback, corrections or suggestions for improvement. A key reason for providing this description box is to provide a textual representation of the map for people using screen readers.</p>
					<h4>The Park</h4>
					<p>Independence National Historical Park is a United States National Park in Philadelphia that preserves several sites associated with the American Revolution and the nation's founding history. The park has been nicknamed "America's most historic square mile". <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_National_Historical_Park'>Wikipedia</a></p>
					<h4>Accessibility</h4>
					<p>The National Park Service (NPS) has made efforts to make the buildings and park areas accessible using ramps, open captioning, assistive listening devices and other features. However, there are some areas that are not accessible and require improvements; these are listed below and indicated on the map along with photographs. The nps.gov website groups accessibility features into three web pages with the following titles:-</p>
